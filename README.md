### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**nina-alf/nina-alf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: a small software for inventory and POS tracking :) with Python and mySQL (mostly)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: a bit of assembly but not much really, I'm on my college holidays! Starting classes in march ğŸ¤“
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: translation, graphic design and coding! Anything open source related would be amazing, I would love to be part of something like that.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: database diagrams ğŸ’€ or any kind of diagrams like UML, class diagrams, use cases diagrams, why are arrows so hard to use? ğŸ˜¢
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: knitting and gaming! If you think about it, knitting is just like programming ğŸ¤“ maybe a really weird metaphor but I really enjoy knitting haha!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my academic email! johanina.alfaro (at) inacapmail.cl -I'm always checking even if I'm on vacay, go say hi! You do not have to be formal, use emojis! :D
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: any pronouns :)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that potatos are NOT a root? In fact, they are stems ğŸ¤“ because they grow roots in them. And fun fact about me: I know many weird fun facts just like that one.
